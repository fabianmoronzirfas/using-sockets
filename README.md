using sockets  
=============


A simple example how to use Processing with socket.io (currently p5 as client only).  

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (best installed on macOS with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [homebrew](https://brew.sh/))  
- [Processing](https://processing.org/)  
- [Processing Websockets by Lasse Vestergaard from the Alexandra Institute](https://github.com/alexandrainst/processing_websockets)

Install the library by putting the whole download into the Processing libraries folder.  

## Usage  

Clone the whole repository and cd into it  

    git clone https://github.com/fabianmoronzirfas/using-sockets.git cd using/sockets/

Install and start the Node.js server

    cd node-server && npm install && npm start

Open the p5client sketch in the Processing IDE and watch the Terminal and the console.
